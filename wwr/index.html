                    <strong>Day and 3-day Trips</strong> <em>(all ages)</em><br>
                    Not everyone can spend a week or two on the river, especially since most rivers have difficult spots, sometimes for miles. 1 or 3 days even works for younger children, so your whole family can enjoy river life. You can even mix your trip to include those that want to skip the difficult areas or don't like camping overnight. All of our adventures have ways to integrate day or three-day participants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note that even when age restrictions may allow for someone to participate, physical fitness/ability are the greatest determining factor for participation.

                    <strong>Adventures</strong> <em>(Experienced Teenagers to Adults)</em><br>
                    Spend a week (or two) out in nature, both on the river and in the canyons and trails alongside them. Our adventures begin with careful meal planning to ensure you have the energy to get through each day and we provide state-of-the-art camping gear so you get the rest you need each night before hitting the rapids and trails again. We have plans for many stops, sites, and even some life lessons along the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adventures are meant for mentally- and physically-abled adults (and mostly adult-sized teenagers) who can swim on their own power without the assistance of a floatation vest.

                    <strong>Expeditions</strong> <em>(Adult groups)</em><br>
                    Usually meant for corporate events, expeditions are meant to be more than just fun, but fun is still a big part of expeditions. Work together closely with our MBA-designed program to help your organization bond and develop critical skills you can bring back with you. From 1/2 day excursions to 2 week-long events, we can help elevate your group to the next level and empower everybody in your team for the rest of their lives,

                    As expeditions are completely bespoke to your organization's needs, please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> to discuss your budget, timing, and ultimate goals. We can even break your expedition over several events.
