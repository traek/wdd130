            <p>Hi, my name is Traek Malan (pronounced TRAYK MAY-len). My wife and I have seven children and one grandchild, so far. We have lived in Maricopa, Arizona, USA, for 15 years. We love our neighbors from all over the United States, snowbirders from Canada, and the Gila River Nation to the immediate North and the Ak-Chin Nation to the immediate South. I volunteer in my community teaching kids 7-17 to approach technology as a creator rather than as a consumer through tinkering, programming, and various "making" skills in an organization I founded call <a href="https://copacoders.club" target="_blank">COPA Coders</a>. I currently serve as our ward's Temple and Family History Leader and love spending time in the <a href="https://locations.familysearch.org/en" target="_blank">FamilySearch Center</a> helping community members research their family histories. My favorite place on earth is with my family; my favorite place to be with them is the temple. Here are some of my favorite temples:</p>
            <ul class="box">
                <li><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/details/manti-utah-temple?lang=eng" target="_blank">Manti Utah Temple</a> - where my wife and I received our endowments, 2 years apart</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/details/bountiful-utah-temple?lang=eng" target="_blank">Bountiful Utah Temple</a> - where my wife and I were married for "time and all eternity"</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/details/jordan-river-utah-temple?lang=eng" target="_blank">Jordan River Temple</a> - where we received special revelation about our children</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/details/caracas-venezuela-temple?lang=eng" target="_blank">Caracas Venezuela Temple</a> - the first temple in the country I served a full-time mission</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/details/gilbert-arizona-temple?lang=eng" target="_blank">Gilbert Arizona Temple</a> - where I served as an ordinance worker for 2 years</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/details/layton-utah-temple?lang=eng" target="_blank">Layton Utah Temple</a> - not yet dedicated, 1 mile away from our first home</li>

            <h2>Arizona</h2>
            <img src="images/desert-oasis.jpg" alt="A desert oasis with blue waterfall located in Arizona">
            <p>Arizona is located in the Southwestern United States, famous for the location of the Grand Canyon. Though largely desert, Arizona is home to diverse environments and supports year-round outdoor activities from golf or skiing to river rafting and spelunking.</p>
