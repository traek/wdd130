            <p>Hi, my name is Traek Malan (pronounced TRAYK MAY-len). I have seven children and we have one grandchild, so far. We have lived in the United States in Arizona, in a big small town named Maricopa, for 15 years. We love our neighbors, including the Gila River Nation to the immediate North and the Ak-Chin Nation to the immediate South. I volunteer in my community teaching kids 7-17 to approach technology as a creator rather than as a consumer through tinkering, programming, and various "making" skills. I currently serve as our ward's Temple and Family History Leader and love spending time in the <a href="https://locations.familysearch.org/en" target="_blank">FamilySearch Center</a> helping community members research their family histories.</p>

            <p>Arizona is located in the Southwestern United States, famous for the location of the Grand Canyon. Though largely desert, Arizona is home to diverse environments and supports year-round outdoor activities from golf or skiing to river rafting and spelunking.</p>
